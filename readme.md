# Goals: Apply Array Exercises

## Objectives:
* Use standard Array and Enumerable methods
* Work with multi-dimensional arrays to gather information

----

## Arrays are everywhere!
Array collections of records in Rails are ubiquitous. It is pretty common in pure
Ruby too to rely on low level data structures for organizing data. This exercise
will take you through a series of spec that increase in difficulty, proving
that arrays aren't always the best way to store data.

## Getting Started

This project comes with a recommended Ruby version and a gemset. There is a Gemfile too.
There is no real code to write. We are just going to be modifying, reading and creating
hashes that live in our test world.

1. Fork this project to your github account
2. Clone it to your computer
3. cd into the project directory
4. `bundle` to get your dependencies in place
5. run the specs with `rspec`
